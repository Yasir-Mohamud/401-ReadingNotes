Unit Testing And Documentation

**Unit testing**
_______________
- Unit testing is isolating and exercising specific units of your code. It does not deal with external systems and their envirnment and many others.There is a framework in VS that helps with unit testing.
- Some good practices are 
1.Arrange,Act,Assert : Making sure to arrange neccesary stuff for the test/method,and using the Assert class to complete the test.
2.One Assert Per Test Method :
To make it easier to know where the error is.
3.Avoid Test Interdependance:
It can cause mix up with other test you might have going on.
4.Keep It Short
5.Recognize Test Setup:
Know what you are doing and there is always more to learn
6.Add Them To The Build

- A way of documenting and keeping track of your work as when time passes you wont be able to remember everything.
- Everyone always starts at the readme as to get a feel of what your application is.It also saves time as devs dont have to delve into your code to understamd it .Plus it should also not be really lengthy.
